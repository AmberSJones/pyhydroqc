# PyHydroQC Functions

The PyHydroQC Python package contains functions for anomaly detection and correction of aquatic sensor data.

The package may be installed from the [Test Python Package Index](https://test.pypi.org/project/pyhydroqc-AmberSJones/).

Also see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AmberSJones/PyHydroQC).

All functions available in the PyHydroQC package are documented here. See the example notebooks and scripts for implementation of the steps and workflow for anomaly detection and correction.
